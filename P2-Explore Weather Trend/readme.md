# P2 - Exploring Weather Trends using Python and SQL

### Selected city: Haora (India)

### Overview
I am from India, so for this project I used the city of Haora, where I am from. So to begin with, the project require the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart which I used to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of Haora to overall global temperature trends. After some data cleaning I created a function to assist with the data processing and visualization process.

### Conclusion
**There is a clear overall uptrend in the average global temperature. From which we can assume that the temperature will keep increasing in future as well**

The Indian city of Haora got compared to the global data (1813 - 2013):

* The place of my stay Haora has a higher average temperature compared to worldâ€™s average temperature, so Haora is hotter than the global average temperature.
* There is a trend of increasing local & global temperature, which is to say that the earth is getting hotter with time. This trend has been consistent through the years, as the chart depicts.
* The moderate correlation shows that temperature difference between Global temperature and Haora temperature is fairly same.
* The slope of the global trend is higher than compared to the german cities, so the global average temperature is increasing faster.
