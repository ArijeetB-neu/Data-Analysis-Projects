I am making a portfolio of projects to show all the aspects of data analyses. Which include cleaning and organizing data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions and clearly communicate critical findings. I have used Python libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for these projects.

## Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis
Subjects Covered:

- Data Analysis Process
- NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
- Pandas Series and Dataframes

### Project 1: Findings from dataset called No Show Appointment data.
I selected this Kaggle dataset and used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and made my conclusions and recommendations in a report.

## Part 2 -Practical Statistics
Subjects Covered:

- Probability
- Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
- Confidence Levels and Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing
- T-tests and A/B test
- Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
### Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv
To goal of the project in this chapter was to get experience with A/B testing, it's difficulties and drawbacks. First of all, we learned what A/B testing is all about - including different metrics like the Click Through Rate (CTR) and how to analyze these metrics properly. Then we learned about the drawbacks like the novelty effect or change aversion. Then using Python, I assessed the quality, tidiness of data and then cleaned it. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python.By using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one.

## Part 3 - Data Extraction and Wrangling
Subjects Covered:

- GATHERING DATA:
    * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
    * Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
    * Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
- ASSESSING DATA
    * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
    * Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
    * Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
- CLEANING DATA
    * Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
    * Clean data using Python and pandas
    * Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python
### Project 4 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.

## Part 4 - Data Visualisation
Subjects Covered:

- Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales )
- Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
- Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature enginnering )
- Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data , polish plots , create slide deck )

### Project 5: Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
