I am making a portfolio of projects to show all the aspects of data analyses. Which include cleaning and organizing data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions and clearly communicate critical findings. I have used Python libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for these projects.

## Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis
Subjects Covered:

- Data Analysis Process
- NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
- Pandas Series and Dataframes

### Project 1: Findings from dataset called No Show Appointment data.
I selected this Kaggle dataset and used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and made my conclusions and recommendations in a report.

## Part 2 - Practical Statistics
Subjects Covered:

- Probability
- Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
- Confidence Levels and Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing
- T-tests and A/B test
- Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
### Project 2: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv
In this project, I assessed the quality, tidiness of data and then cleaned it using Python. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python. Finally used AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one.

## Part 3 - Data Visualisation
Subjects Covered:

- Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales )
- Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
- Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature engineering )
- Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data , polish plots , create slide deck )

### Project 3: Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
