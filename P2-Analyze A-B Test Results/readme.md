# UdacityProject_Analyze A/B Test Results
## Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree P3 - Analyze A/B Test Results of an e-commerce company

### Data Sources
**Name:** ab_data.csv
- Source: Udacity


### Overview
In this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Conclusion
There is no significant impact of the new page and countries on conversion rates. So the company shouldn't implement this new page since there is no evidence to prove so.
